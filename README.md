# Tibetan-Auto-keyboard-data
Here is a suggested improvement to the autocorrection readme.md 

The present data is not sufficient to be called “Auto-keyboard-data” as it does not have frequency counts. Most auto-completion lists also have a third field, which marks rude words (swear words) that should not be suggested for auto-completion.

Existing text:

Tibetan-Auto-keyboard-data

This list for Auto-keyboard, it is included more than one hundred thousand words.

New text:

Tibetan-word-list

This is a Tibetan word list of 107,000 entries. It is sorted alphabetically. 

In future, it is planned to add frequency data and sort the list by frequency of occurance so that the list can be used for keyboard auto-completion applications.
